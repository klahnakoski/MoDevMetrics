	<h2>Bugzilla Anthropology Metrics Prototypes</h2><br>

	These charts serve two purposes.  The first is to satisfy one of the specific needs of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla_Anthropology">Bugzilla
		Anthropology Project</a> which was to provide a view into patch review times.  The second is to prove
		ElasticSearch can be used a performant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">data warehouse</a>.
		More on the project and conclusions can be found at the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Bugzilla_Anthropology/2013-01-29">Jan 2013 project summary</a>.
		There is also my <a href="docs/Bugs in ES.pdf">DashCon presentation</a> (<a href="docs/Bugs in ES.pptx">PPT</a>)<br>

					<span class="info">Counts review requests and review completion rates.  Also breaks down aggregate
						review age.  The first review has been shown to take significantly longer </span>

					<a href="es/ReviewIntensity.html">ReviewIntensity</a>

					<span class="info">Metrics' ES cluster is on old unstable hardware.  Sometimes the hardware fails,

					<a href="es/Test-Hierarchy.html">Test Bug Dependency Tracking</a>
					<span class="info">There are many opportunities for tracking projects by their dependency tree.

					<span class="info">How quickly are patches being opened and	closed?  How many are left open
